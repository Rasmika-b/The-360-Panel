### Scope

This is a solar panel tracking device designed for aligning solar panels with the sun's position. The device operates by monitoring light intensity using Light Dependent Resistors (LDR), which are integrated with resistors and servo motors for control.

### Methodology

The Solar Panel is divided into two sections. The upper row, you can observe the front view of the solar panel, while the lower row provides a view from the back. The solar panel's rotational system sweeps across the horizon, meticulously assessing the sun's current position. This assessment is crucial in determining the optimal orientation for capturing the maximum solar energy available. The solar panel autonomously orients itself towards the position with the highest energy potential, which is then utilized to charge the battery.
