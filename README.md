# The-360-Panel

- Solar energy is rapidly emerging as a pivotal source of renewable energy. Solar tracking, a technology facilitating optimal energy generation, achieves this by ensuring that solar panels maintain a perpendicular orientation to the sun's rays. This paper delves into the design and construction of a solar tracker prototype boasting single-axis rotation. The system relies on Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) to gauge sunlight intensity. The core of this solar tracking system is built upon the Arduino Uno micro-controller platform, carefully programmed to activate a servo motor aligning the solar panel with the direction of maximum sunlight intensity, as determined by the LDR pair.

- This innovative solar tracking system holds significant potential for efficient electricity generation across various applications, including remote residences, livestock management, agricultural irrigation, pool filtration, and solar heating. Depending on factors such as geographical location and specific system parameters, this proposed solar tracking system has the potential to boost efficiency by a remarkable margin, ranging from 35% to 60%.
